# Rust Learning Journey

A collection of Rust projects and exercises from my learning path.

## What's inside

- `100-exercises-to-learn-rust/` — structured exercises and the accompanying book content
- `self_code_practice/` — smaller experiments and practice snippets

## Getting started

Each folder is its own Cargo project. Example:

```bash
cd self_code_practice
cargo run
```

## Notes

- Build artifacts are ignored (`target/`).
- Feel free to explore individual projects independently.
